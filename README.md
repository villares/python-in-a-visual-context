# Python in a visual context
Learn Python by drawing things.

This repo will house my learning/teaching materials translated from Portuguese-language [material-aulas (Python + py5)](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/material-aulas/Processing-Python-py5/), 80+ pages. To do so, I need more patrons at https://liberapay.com/villares.
Resources for courses and workshops, being developed in this [repository](https://github.com/villares/python-visual-context/).

# Educational content

**[Python 3 with py5 teaching materials](Processing-Python-py5/README.md)**

## Context
> This started with materials teach/learn coding using Processing Python mode, in Portuguese, then it got converted to use **py5**, and now it is being translated into English.
> You should check out other Python drawing tools:
> - [pyp5js](https://github.com/berinhard/pyp5js), combines pyodide and p5js, try an [**online editor alternative**](https://abav.local.com/pyp5js/py5mode/) with py5 names.
> - Other [Processing + Python tools table](https://github.com/villares/Resources-for-teaching-programming#processing--python-tools-table).
